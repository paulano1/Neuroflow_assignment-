**Why not use react**

I tried not to use any libraries in the code to show my competence with javascript and making it as simple as possible. 
That is the reason I decided to use just html and js to complete the assignment and added a bit of styling with CSS.
**To run the application**
1. download all the files
 
2. run index.html

**my usual stack consists of react/and other js libraries; refer to my beanstocks project https://github.com/paulano1/beanstocks to check my competence with react and other js libraries**
